Trial Court held that the Release Deed was void, since Chandran had no inheritable right in 1975 (his father was still alive).
High Court reversed the decision, ruling that the appellants were estopped from claiming a share as their father had accepted consideration for relinquishment.

Following the inquiry, his services were terminated on 6 August 1998.
Sharma challenged his termination before the Rajasthan Non-Governmental Educational Institutions Tribunal, which set aside the termination, ruling that the mandatory prior approval of the Director of Education (as required under Section 18 of the Act, 1989) was not obtained.
The Single Judge of the High Court upheld the Tribunal’s ruling.
The Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court reversed the decision, relying on the Larger Bench ruling in Central Academy Society vs. Rajasthan Non-Govt.

The borrower defaulted, leading Kotak Mahindra Bank to initiate recovery proceedings under the SARFAESI Act.
The bank filed an application under Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act before the District Magistrate (Dhar) on 17.06.2014, seeking assistance in taking possession of the secured assets.
The District Magistrate allowed the request on 24.09.2014, directing possession to be taken.
However, possession was not executed due to an existing recovery certificate issued in favor of Girnar Corrugators Pvt. Ltd. under the MSMED Act.
Naib Tehsildar refused to take possession, citing that the MSMED Act overrides the SARFAESI Act.
Kotak Mahindra Bank challenged the order before the Madhya Pradesh High Court, where:
The Single Judge ruled in favor of Kotak Mahindra Bank, stating SARFAESI Act prevails over MSMED Act.
The Division Bench overturned the ruling, holding that MSMED Act prevails over SARFAESI Act because it is a later enactment.
Kotak Mahindra Bank appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing:
No repugnancy exists between SARFAESI and MSMED Act.
SARFAESI Act (Section 26E) specifically provides for priority to secured creditors.
The MSMED Act does not contain an express provision for priority over secured creditors.
The High Court erred in holding that MSMED Act, being later in time, should prevail.

The company was undergoing insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, with a moratorium imposed on payments from 11.09.2018 to 24.07.2020.
During this period, the Sabka Vishwas (Legacy Dispute Resolution) Scheme, 2019 (SVLDRS) was introduced to settle pending tax disputes.
The company applied for the scheme within the deadline (Form No.1 issued on 27.12.2019), and the tax dues were determined as ₹1,24,28,500 (Form No.3 issued on 25.02.2020).
The payment deadline under the scheme was extended to 30.06.2020 due to COVID-19.
The moratorium under IBC prevented the company from making any payments until 24.07.2020, when the resolution plan was approved by NCLT.
After the moratorium ended, the company sought permission to make the payment, but the tax department rejected the request, citing that the scheme had ended on 30.06.2020.
The Allahabad High Court dismissed the writ petition, ruling that:
The SVLDRS deadline could not be extended.
The Designated Committee under the scheme no longer existed.
The company appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing:
It was legally barred from making payments during the moratorium, making compliance impossible.
The tax department should allow payment as the application was submitted and approved within time.

Dey later moved to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and allegedly executed a Power of Attorney (PoA) from there in favor of Plaintiff No.2.
Using the PoA, Plaintiff No.2 executed a sale deed in his own favor on 3.9.1968 and later transferred the land to his wife, Plaintiff No.1 (Gita Rani Saha), on 29.09.1968.
Defendants (Majumdar family) claimed possession of the land for over 40 years, arguing they were rightful owners and that the sale deed was invalid.
The plaintiffs filed a suit for title declaration and possession (T.S. No. 201/1985) before the Trial Court.

The PoA was not produced as evidence.
Sale deeds were not properly authenticated under Section 33(1)(c) of the Registration Act, 1908.

Plaintiffs failed to prove ownership.

The society runs schools, a medical center, an old age home, and is building a hospital in Odisha.
It was granted tax exemption under Sections 12AA and 80G of the Income Tax Act.
The Income Tax Department denied the exemption for Assessment Years 2010-11 and 2011-12, arguing:
The society was engaged in trade, commerce, or business through managing a printing press and publishing a newspaper (""Samaj"").
It earned substantial revenue from advertisements.
The Appellate Commissioner and ITAT ruled in favor of the society, affirming that it remained a charitable trust and was entitled to exemption.
The Delhi High Court upheld the ITAT’s ruling.
The Income Tax Department appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that:
The society was involved in business activities beyond charity.
The Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) judgment (2022 SCC Online SC 1461) required stricter scrutiny of organizations claiming public utility status.
Advertisement revenue indicated commercial activity, which should disqualify the society from exemption.","Income Tax Act, 1961

The incident occurred on 14.05.2004 at 6:00 AM, with a witness (PW2) present.
The accused showed no attempt to escape, was later found sitting at a bus stand, and was known to have a history of schizophrenia.
The defense argued that the accused suffered from chronic schizophrenia and invoked Section 84 IPC (Act of a person of unsound mind).
Evidence from two doctors (AW1 and AW2) confirmed prior treatment for schizophrenia and that he was prescribed ‘Thioril’, a psychiatric medication.
Despite medical evidence, the Trial Court convicted him under Section 302 IPC, sentencing him to life imprisonment.
The Bombay High Court (Goa Bench) upheld the conviction, dismissing the plea of insanity.
The accused appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing:
He was under schizophrenia-induced delusions at the time of the offense.
His prior medical history was ignored by lower courts.

Gavai, Justice Vikram Nath        ","January 18, 2023",Appeal Partly Allowed ,"The case involved a cheque bounce dispute and related civil suits for money recovery.
In 1992, Rajaram’s wife joined a chit-fund run by Maruthachalam.
To ensure participation, Rajaram issued two blank cheques (Nos. 237954 and 237956) as security.
The chit matured in 1997, but his wife never won a bid, so they demanded a refund of ₹6,00,000.
Instead of refunding, Maruthachalam and his brother-in-law Nachimuthu presented the cheques in 1999.
The cheques bounced due to account closure in 1997, leading to:
Criminal complaints under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NIA).
Civil suits for money recovery, claiming the cheques were issued for debt repayment.
The Trial Court dismissed the criminal cases and civil suits, holding:
The cheques were issued as security, not for debt repayment.
There was no evidence of a legally enforceable debt.
The High Court reversed the acquittal and decreed the civil suits, holding that:
The signed cheques created a presumption of debt.
The burden was on Rajaram to disprove liability.
Rajaram (now represented by legal heirs) appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing:
The cheques were misused years after the chit-fund ended.
No proof of loan or promissory notes existed.
The complainants lacked financial capacity to lend ₹6,00,000.

Ravikumar","January 4, 2023",Appeal Dismissed,"Sabarmati Gas Limited (SGL) supplied natural gas to Shah Alloys Limited (SAL) under a Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) dated 30.05.2008.
SAL defaulted on payments from November 2011, leading to an outstanding debt of ₹4,71,56,095.
SAL was declared a ""sick company"" by the BIFR on 31.08.2010, restricting creditors from initiating recovery actions under Section 22(1) of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (SICA).
SGL stopped the gas supply on 07.08.2012 and sought permission from BIFR in 2013 to initiate legal action.
SICA was repealed on 01.12.2016, and IBC provisions came into effect the same day.
SGL issued a demand notice under Section 8 IBC on 01.04.2017 seeking repayment.
SAL replied on 10.04.2017, claiming a shortfall in gas supply and damages due to disconnection.
SGL filed an application under Section 9 IBC before NCLT Ahmedabad on 20.08.2018, seeking CIRP initiation against SAL.
NCLT dismissed the application on 27.06.2019, citing:

Ltd. (Tata Sons) entered into a Share Subscription Agreement (SSA) on 24 February 2006 with Siva Industries and Holdings Ltd. (Siva Industries) and Tata Teleservices Ltd. (TTSL) for the issuance and allotment of shares in TTSL.
A secondary share purchase agreement was signed on 3 March 2009, under which NTT Docomo acquired shares of TTSL from Siva Industries.
The Shareholders' Agreement dated 25 March 2009 included a sale option clause, which allowed Docomo to sell its shares back to Tata Sons.
Docomo invoked its sale option on 7 July 2014, leading to a financial obligation for Tata Sons.
Tata Sons sought proportionate payment from Siva Industries under the ""Inter Se Agreement"", as Siva was obliged to buy back a portion of the shares.
Siva Industries failed to comply, leading Tata Sons to issue an arbitration notice on 15 June 2017 under Clause 10 of the Inter Se Agreement, which designated Mumbai as the seat of arbitration.
Siva Industries did not appoint an arbitrator, prompting Tata Sons to approach the Supreme Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, for the constitution of an arbitral tribunal.
On 17 January 2018, Justice S.N. Variava (Retd.) was appointed as the sole arbitrator.
During the arbitration proceedings, IDBI Bank Ltd. initiated insolvency proceedings against Siva Industries under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, leading to a moratorium on proceedings against Siva from 5 July 2019.
Tata Sons sought an extension of the tribunal’s mandate due to the delay caused by the IBC moratorium.
Siva Industries was released from CIRP on 3 June 2022, following an order by the Supreme Court.
Tata Sons applied for a continuation of the arbitration without requiring an extension from the court or, alternatively, for a formal extension of the arbitrator’s mandate.

Ravikumar        ","February 24, 2023",Appeal Partly Allowed ,"The case arises from an alleged assault and kidnapping involving then Maharashtra Cabinet Minister Jitendra Awhad.
On 5 April 2020, the appellant, a civil engineer, shared a Facebook post criticizing Jitendra Awhad for ridiculing the Prime Minister.
On the same night (at 11:50 PM), four police officers (two in civilian clothes and two in uniform) forcibly took the appellant to the Minister's bungalow.
At the Minister’s residence, he was beaten by the Minister’s aides, forced to apologize, and threatened to delete the post.
His wife received a call from one of the Minister’s aides, instructing her to delete the post.
The next day (6 April 2020), he filed an FIR (No. 120/2020) at Vartak Nagar Police Station, alleging kidnapping, assault, and criminal intimidation.
However, the police did not initially name Jitendra Awhad as an accused.
A separate FIR (No. 119/2020) was filed against the appellant under Section 292 IPC and Section 66(E) of the IT Act, based on a complaint by one of Awhad’s close aides.
The appellant approached the Bombay High Court, seeking a CBI investigation, alleging bias and cover-up in the police investigation.
Despite High Court monitoring, the police initially did not charge the Minister.
Jitendra Awhad was named as an accused only two years later, following court intervention.
The Trial Court framed charges against the accused based on lesser offenses, excluding serious charges such as Section 326 IPC (grievous hurt) and Section 367 IPC (kidnapping for grievous hurt).
The Bombay High Court dismissed the appellant's writ petition, refusing to order a CBI probe or further investigation, prompting the appeal before the Supreme Court.

Ravikumar        ","February 3, 2023",Appeal Partly Allowed ,"The petitioners were Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders, mostly students who had pursued their education in India and sought admission to medical colleges through the NEET examination.
Before 2021, OCI cardholders had the right to compete for admission on par with Indian citizens under notifications issued in 2005, 2007, and 2009.
On 4 March 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued a notification restricting OCI admissions to only NRI quota seats or supernumerary seats, removing their previous parity with Indian citizens.
Petitioners argued that the new rule violated their legitimate expectation, was discriminatory under Article 14, and constituted retrogression of their rights.
The Union of India defended the notification, stating that:
OCI status is a privilege, not a right, and India has sovereign power to restrict benefits.
The notification aimed to protect medical seats for Indian citizens due to limited availability.
The 2021 notification merely clarified that OCI holders were always meant to be treated as NRIs.
The petitioners sought to quash Clause 4(ii), its proviso, and Explanation (1) of the 2021 notification and restore their right to general category admissions.

Ramasubramanian, Justice B.V. Nagarathna","February 20, 2023",Appeal Allowed,"Aparna Ajinkya Firodia (Appellant) and Ajinkya Arun Firodia (Respondent) were married on 23 November 2005.
They had two children:
First child: Hridaan Firodia (Born 21 December 2009).
Second child: Arjun Firodia (Born 17 July 2013).
On 1 June 2017, the husband filed for divorce under Sections 13(1)(i) & (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, alleging that his wife had an adulterous relationship with one Kshitij Bafna.
He claimed to have discovered intimate messages on his wife’s phone on 14 September 2016, indicating an affair.
The husband conducted a private DNA test on 24 November 2016, at DNA Labs India, which showed a 0% probability that he was the biological father of Arjun.
On 9 November 2020, the husband filed an application before the Family Court in Pune, seeking a Court-ordered DNA test for Arjun to prove the alleged infidelity.
The Family Court allowed the application on 12 August 2021, ruling that:
The DNA test was essential to establish adultery.
If the wife refused, an adverse inference could be drawn under Section 114(h) of the Indian Evidence Act.
The Bombay High Court upheld this order on 22 November 2021.
The wife challenged this decision before the Supreme Court, arguing that:
The presumption of legitimacy under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act must be upheld.
The DNA test was unnecessary since the husband did not claim non-access at the time of conception.
The child’s right to privacy must be protected.
The husband could prove adultery through other means without subjecting the child to trauma.
